## Examples

Here are some example / sample scripts for you to take a look at, and use to build your own LuaASM / TPScript scripts!

### Directory Listings

#### comradio
comradio is a protocol made for communication between Roblox servers.</br>
Without knowledge on implementing and reading from the protocol or an existing script that uses comradio, it will not work.</br>
Also, this example doesn't use the most up-to-date(?) protocol of comradio (I'm pretty sure it uses V2).

#### F3X loader
F3X is an "alternative" to the Studio editor tools that also works in-game.</br>
You can export your creations to the F3X servers which gives you a code.</br>
This F3X loader can load your builds (give and take some instances not working as intended to make the script simple)</br>

#### Rewelder
The simplest example of them all, it rejoints your character into Welds (for server-side animating).</br>
It isn't helpful for any applications but *was* a good learning experience.

### Additional Notes

Most of the examples here use syntax only supported by LuaASM, and likely won't work in TPScript.</br>
(Although, if you want to try porting any of them, go ahead. I couldn't care less)
